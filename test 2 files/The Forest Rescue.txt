Title: The Forest Rescue

Max, a golden retriever with an adventurous spirit, lived near the edge of Pinewood Forest. Every morning, he would dash through the trees chasing the scent of rabbits and listening to the wind rustle the leaves. His owner, Lily, trusted him enough to explore on his own, as he always returned before sunset.

One day, Max heard a faint whimper coming from deep in the woods. Following the sound, he found a small puppy trapped under a fallen branch. The pup’s paw was bleeding, and it was trembling in fear. Max barked loudly, signaling for help, but there was no one around to hear him.

Thinking quickly, Max dug at the ground and managed to nudge the branch enough to free the puppy. The little one, a black-and-white beagle, licked Max’s nose in gratitude. Max gently carried it back to Lily’s farmhouse.

Lily cleaned the puppy’s wound and wrapped it in a soft towel. “You’re a hero, Max,” she said, patting his head. She decided to name the new puppy Scout.

From that day forward, Max and Scout became inseparable. They played together, explored the forest, and even shared the same bed on cold nights. The forest had brought them together, and their friendship became legendary in the small town of Willow Glen.
