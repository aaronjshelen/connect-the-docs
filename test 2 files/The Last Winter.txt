Title: The Last Winter

Years passed in Willow Glen, and Max grew old. His muzzle turned gray, and his steps became slower, but his heart was still strong. Scout and Rusty always stayed by his side, watching over him the same way he once did for them.

That winter was colder than usual. Snow covered the forest paths where Max had once run with boundless energy. Lily laid extra blankets by the fire and made sure the dogs were warm every night.

One morning, Max didn’t wake up. The sun rose gently over the hills, casting golden light across the snow. Scout nudged him softly, then rested beside him, understanding what had happened. Lily knelt and whispered through tears, “Thank you, Max.”

The whole town attended a small memorial under the old oak tree near the forest. Children left flowers, and the newspaper printed a story titled “The Hero of Pinewood Forest.”

Though Max was gone, his spirit lingered in the wagging tails and loyal hearts of Scout, Rusty, and every dog that called Willow Glen home. And on quiet mornings, Lily could still hear his bark echoing faintly through the forest.
