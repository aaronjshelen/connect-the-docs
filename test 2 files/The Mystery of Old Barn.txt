Title: The Mystery of Old Barn

Down the road from Lily’s farmhouse stood an abandoned red barn. Rumors said it was haunted, and even the bravest kids in Willow Glen avoided it. But not Scout. His curiosity often got the better of him.

One afternoon, Scout convinced Rusty to sneak into the barn while Max napped. Inside, it was dark and smelled of dust and hay. As they explored, Scout suddenly froze—he heard scratching sounds from behind a pile of crates.

Rusty growled softly, but Scout approached and pawed at the crates. Out popped a small kitten, frightened but unharmed. The scratching had just been the kitten trying to escape. Scout barked with excitement, tail wagging.

Lily, hearing the commotion, arrived just in time to see Scout carrying the kitten carefully in his mouth. She took it home, and it quickly became part of their little family. Max, upon waking up, gave Scout a disapproving look as if saying, “Not another one.”

The old barn mystery was solved, but the story spread through town that the “ghost” of the barn was actually a tiny kitten saved by brave dogs. Scout, Rusty, and Max’s legend grew even larger.
