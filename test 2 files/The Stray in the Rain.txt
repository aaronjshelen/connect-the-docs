Title: The Stray in the Rain

A week after the festival, a heavy rainstorm swept through Willow Glen. Lily kept Max and Scout inside, curled up near the fireplace. Thunder shook the windows, and Scout whimpered softly. He hated storms.

Late that night, Max’s ears perked up—he heard something outside. Despite the rain, he barked and nudged the door until Lily opened it. There, soaked to the bone, stood a stray dog with matted fur and tired eyes.

Lily quickly brought the dog inside and wrapped it in a towel. The newcomer was timid, flinching at every sound, but Max and Scout approached slowly, tails wagging. The stray relaxed and leaned into Max’s warmth.

After a warm meal and a good night’s rest, the stray began to wag his tail again. Lily named him Rusty because of his reddish fur. Though Rusty had no family, he soon became part of theirs.

From then on, Max, Scout, and Rusty became known as the “Willow Glen Trio.” They were often seen together, running through puddles after the rain or lounging on Lily’s porch, enjoying the sunshine.
