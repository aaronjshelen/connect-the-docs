Title: The Town Festival

Scout was now fully grown, though still mischievous at heart. The annual Willow Glen Festival was coming up, and Lily planned to bring both Max and Scout to the event. The whole town loved seeing the dogs perform little tricks on stage.

When the festival began, Scout was eager to show off. He spun, jumped, and even balanced a small stick on his nose to the crowd’s delight. Max, older and calmer, wagged his tail proudly as he watched his friend steal the show.

In the middle of the laughter and cheers, Scout spotted a familiar face—Charlie, the baker’s border collie, who had once gotten lost in the same forest where Max had rescued him. They barked excitedly at each other and began to run circles around the festival tents.

Their playful chase led to a minor disaster: they knocked over a lemonade stand. Everyone gasped, but Lily and Charlie’s owner couldn’t help but laugh. “Guess we’ve got our festival clowns!” they said.

By the end of the day, the crowd voted Max, Scout, and Charlie the honorary mascots of Willow Glen. Their picture was printed in the local paper under the headline “Paws and Applause at the Festival.”
