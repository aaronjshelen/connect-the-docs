Title: Energy Analytics and Grid Optimization

Energy analytics platforms are transforming how grid operators and traders make decisions. 
By aggregating data from solar, wind, and market sources, these systems provide insights 
into locational marginal pricing (LMP), congestion, and renewable curtailment. 
Machine learning models identify patterns in demand, forecast errors, and price spikes, 
helping utilities optimize dispatch and trading strategies.

The integration of renewable energy forecasting—especially solar and wind—into analytics dashboards 
enables proactive grid management. Data-driven decision-making, powered by AI and predictive analytics, 
is becoming the cornerstone of energy market optimization.
