Title: Solar Forecasting Trends in Modern Energy Markets

Solar forecasting plays a crucial role in balancing supply and demand within modern power grids. 
Machine learning models, particularly those based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and LSTMs, 
are now used to predict solar generation based on satellite imagery, irradiance, and weather data. 
Accurate solar forecasting enables better day-ahead and real-time market bidding, reducing imbalance costs 
for energy traders and operators.

As renewable penetration increases, utilities rely heavily on probabilistic forecasts to manage uncertainty. 
Partnerships between utilities and data science teams have led to improved predictive models that integrate 
historical performance with near-term meteorological inputs.
