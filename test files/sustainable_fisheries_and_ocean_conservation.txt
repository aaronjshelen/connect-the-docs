Title: Sustainable Fisheries and Ocean Conservation

Sustainable fisheries management ensures that fish populations remain healthy while meeting human demand. Overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change threaten marine biodiversity and food security worldwide.

Policies that support sustainability often integrate scientific monitoring of fish stocks, the use of selective fishing gear, and the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). These MPAs serve as safe zones where fish populations can recover and spill over into surrounding waters.

Public awareness and education campaigns are essential for ocean conservation. Consumers can influence sustainability through choices such as purchasing certified seafood and reducing plastic waste that harms marine life.

Key Terms:
- Overfishing: The excessive harvesting of fish faster than they can reproduce.
- Fish Stock Assessment: The scientific evaluation of fish population size.
- Marine Ecosystem: The complex network of interactions among marine species and their environment.
