Title: Climate Change and Fish Migration Patterns

Climate change is reshaping global fish migration routes as ocean temperatures rise and oxygen levels decrease. Many species are shifting toward cooler waters, altering the structure of marine ecosystems and fishing economies.

In tropical regions, coral reef degradation from bleaching events reduces available habitat for reef-dependent species. Conversely, temperate zones are experiencing new species introductions as fish expand their range northward.

Researchers track migration changes using satellite tagging and oceanographic models. Understanding these shifts is crucial for updating sustainable fisheries management and conserving marine biodiversity.

Key Terms:
- Migration: The large-scale movement of species between habitats.
- Coral Reef Degradation: The decline of coral structures due to stress factors like heat and pollution.
- Ocean Acidification: The decrease in pH of seawater due to increased COâ‚‚ absorption.
