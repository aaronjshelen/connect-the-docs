Title: Marine Biodiversity and Coral Reef Fish

Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on the planet, supporting thousands of fish species. These habitats provide food, shelter, and breeding grounds for organisms ranging from tiny damselfish to large predators like groupers.

Fish diversity in coral reefs contributes to ecological balance. Herbivorous species control algae growth, while carnivores regulate prey populations. The interactions between reef fish and coral health are vital; when coral bleaching events occur due to rising ocean temperatures, fish populations decline accordingly.

Marine biologists use reef fish populations as indicators of ocean health. Conservation strategies often include establishing marine protected areas (MPAs) to preserve fish diversity and habitat complexity.

Key Terms:
- Biodiversity: The variety of life in a habitat or ecosystem.
- Coral Bleaching: The loss of symbiotic algae due to heat stress.
- Marine Protected Area (MPA): A designated zone to limit human activities and conserve ecosystems.
